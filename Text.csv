T00001,Silent China,,en,P0001,G01,PL0003,1932,Beixin shuju,1932,,no,0,0,The text can be found in Lu Xun quanji 4:11-17. Originally published in 三闲集  an essay collection written between 1927 and 1929  first published as a collection in 1932 by Beixin shuju. In the essay Lu Xun 'critized the large-scale suppression of speech and writing during the Qing dynasty and the early Republican era for producing a 'silent China' ... for centuries. He had expected that the May Fourth New Culture Movement would restore regular speech to China by offering a new language more accessible to the common people  by facilitating the circulation of modern ideas  and by creating a genuine voice for a new era. But the success of the modern vernacular was not enough to transform the country into an 'articulate China'...'
